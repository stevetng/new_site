                My favorite blogs:
                    <li><a href="paulgraham.com"target="_blank">Paul Graham</a> - specifically his writing on <a href="https://paulgraham.com/cities.html"target="_blank">cities</a>. This post kick started my brain on how to describe cities beyong the generic descriptors like food quality + public transporation people usually cite. My take? Choose a city where you feel most like yourself.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/"target="_blank">Works in Progress</a> - specifically the piece on <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-prediction-markets-arent-popular/"target="_blank">prediction markets</a>. This blog opened my eyes to what makes writing truly persuasive. The writers for works in progress are quite good at presenting an argument and addressing counter arguments the moment you begin to think of them.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.avabear.xyz/about"target="_blank">Ava Bookbear</a> - specifically the piece on <a href="https://www.avabear.xyz/p/the-true-shape-of-a-thing"target="_blank">the true shape of a thing</a>. If something feels good, you can just do it and continue doing it, sharing it with the world and seeing where it takes you. Ava consistently puts the complex into digestible, impactful writing.</li>
                </p>
                <p>
                Media that fundamentally changed me.
                    <li>Season 2, Episode 7 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)"target="_blank">The Bear</a> – “Forks”. It's never and I mean never too late to redefine yourself. You can just do things.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/"target="_blank">About Time</a> - About Time is like a warm hug that will comfort you at all the different phases of life. Love is not about being perfect. Stop living life like you wanted a second chance at everyday. Take whatever life throws at you and face it with grace. </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/When-Breath-Becomes-Paul-Kalanithi/dp/081298840X"target="_blank">When Breath Becomes Air - Paul Kalanithi</a> - There’s no one better to talk about life than those who are closest to death. This book conviced me that I can pursue a "higher calling" while not getting lost that pursuit. That I can also find meaning in the mundane. </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0061122416"target="_blank">The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho</a> - When you vocalize your goals + dreams into the world, the whole world conspires to help you get there. If love is meant to be, letting go will not mean it's gone.</li>

                            We follow the same format every week, I bring Munchkins, we do intros with a fun question, 2 hours~ deep work, we eat Munchkins and then we show each other what we worked on. Food and a purpose for meeting is all you really need to have a good event/hang.

                        It’s also my way of fighting back against the loneliness epidemic. I’ve been able to see others in our community find the friends that make them feel creative and comfortable in their curiosity. 
                        We've met a ton of really fun friends by making things we care about—and want to find other caring tinkerers!
